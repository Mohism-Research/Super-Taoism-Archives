Last weekend, I watched 《Gaudians of Galaxy:2》. It's a really awesome sifi move, although the first episode is little better. In this episode, star lord meets with his biological father: Ego. EGO is a kind of Alien with very powerfull capability! Actually, he is a planet whose core is his giant brain. It is said that his brain was formed naturally in the universe. Years passing by, the brain cound control surrounding dusts and particles. Finally, the brain planet appeared! It's a wonderful fantasy, but it has theoretical fundamentals. It is called Boltzmann brain which comes from Physical cosmology. However, it's just a hypothesis right now. It mainly describes that the probability of generating consciousness is higher than the probability of generating consciousness's carrier in the space, such as the human body. Theoretically, there should be many consciousnesses like Boltsman brains in the universe, but we still haven't found them right now. The details are more mathematical, I still can't understand it. But the phenomenon that many brains travel in the universe is very funny.

After the completion of Stochastic Process's test, I think I need to dig more deep about Stochastic Process, it's a tough course whose contents are very new, the majoirty of its theories are developed in 20 centry. It mainly describe some Probability Models' behavior on the time dimention, such as: Poisson Process, Markov chains, Martingales. Besides research on that, I also have to learn advanced statistics in coming 3 months.

Time flies fast! More than half year have passed since last write, it seems that I didn't make the great progress. Although I have completed five courses from deeplearning.ai, I think it's not enough. I want to write a small book to note the stuffs I learned from the courses.  $x^{(i)}$

From now on, I will try my best to update this note everyday. Because I have not writen English essays for long time. Two months ago, I joined a Writing Community based on WeChat which is called as "007". The membership needs spending 400 RMB, then the 007er have to write an essay per week. It's a great community which can help me to tackle my procastination. However we almost write essays in Chinese. So I decided to write more English documents. Writing daily notes is just a starting point, I should write an official essay per week.

Last week, I created an English writing club from my 007 community. Driving people to write English essays was hard, because writing in non native-language is a very chanllenging thing for anyone. That is the reason why I always pushed myself to use English. I have plan: if our group could genertate around 10 highly qulified essays per month, we should try to public a monthly magazine using gitbook.

The steemit is a writing platform based on BlockChain, and I believe that bihu is copying steemit's whole idea. In order to write English articles, I registered an account on steemit. Now I found that it's hard to write one article without inspirations.

Today is very hot, but the air quality is not bad. The sky is very blue as autumn's with some clouds.

Daily writing is a very chanllenging task for me. At present I don't afraid of writing, but finding topic is a little bit dfficult for me. Fortunately these days I figured out one method to write everyday, the Feynman technique. Using Feyman technique to write essays is not easy, firstly we need to absorb enough knowledges and have deep understanding of the contents that we want to write. I always want writing to boost my academic underatanding and technological improvements. But since join 007 community, I found that I was writing for writing all the time. I need to change this situation. At least, daily writing on github is a good start.

How time flies! It has been more than 4 years since last note. During these years, I have shift job, and learn FPGA technology. It's pretty not easy. However, My personal problem is still not solved.
